        <h1>Greek Pasta Salad</h1>

        <p><h2>It's hard to go wrong here</h2></p>
        <p>If you've been reading my blog for a while, you know I just don't like very intensive
            cooking processes. I want to be actively cooking for as little as possible if I can help it.
            This greek pasta salad is one of my go tos for the potluck, the meal prep, the "screw it give 
            me the carbs" day, or a quick and easy weekend lunch.
        </p>
        <p>It is infinitely customizable. Half the time, I just replace the pasta with chickpeas when I 
            feel the need for some protein. You can leave out the olives if you hate them. Add in some bell 
            peppers if you've got some particularly good and sweet one. The only musts in this recipe are 
            the traditional ingredients: The cucumber, tomato, and feta cheese.
