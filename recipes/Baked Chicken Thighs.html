        <h1>Baked Chicken Thighs</h1>
        <p><img src="../images/thighs.jpg"></p>
    
        <p><h2>They key is the crispy crust</h2></p>
        <p>This is one of those meals where, as we used to say back in the day, you set it and <em>forget it</em>
            In fact, the instructions are so simple, you will probably only need to make it once. You'll see what
            I mean below. 
        </p>
        <p>We are just going to season our chicken to whatever level we like, and pop it in the oven for 45-55 
            minutes. The chicken thigh is pretty resilient to cooking at high temperatures, so you don't need
            to worry about it drying out. And when you cook it at a high temp--425 is what I call for here--
            then you get a delicious crispy, cracklin skin. The recipe calls for salt & pepper. Those two alone
            make a great baked chicken, but you can add garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, cayenne,
            or whatever you normally use for poultry.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients (serves 2)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken thighs, patted dry</li>
            <li>salt & pepper to taste (again, feel free to add any other spices)</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees</li>
        <li>Place the chicken thighs skin side up on a baking sheet or dish with at least an inch of height</li>
        <li>Cook at 425 for 45-55 minutes uncovered. This will vary, so the best thing to do is check internal temp with
            a meat thermometer.
        </li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, go do something else! Or work on a nice veggie to pair with the chicken</li>
        </ol>
