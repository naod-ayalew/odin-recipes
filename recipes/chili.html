        <p><h2>Oh so hearty, oh so filling</h2></p>
        <p>Chili meets so many of my easy-cooking criteria. You don't need to babysit the chili pot, it
            is very affordable, and it packs a richness of savory and spicy flavors. And it is something   
            you can make differently each time depending on what you feel like putting in. 
        </p>
        <p>For the base you'll need ground beef (or turkey if you're a stickler for calories), diced tomatoes, tomato paste,
            seasoning, and beans. Beyond that, you can add whatever floats your little boat. You can add corn,
            onions, bell peppers, or even beer for a interesting kick. Pick different types of chili powders 
            and see what works best.
